## Getting Started
An open-source agricultural robotics platform integrating key software projects into a coherent containerised stack.

Documenting two open hardware platforms, a small development rover and a full scale ag rover.

# Core ROS2 Packages

### ublox_dgnss
UBLOX UBX messaging, for ZED-X20P, ZED-F9P and ZED-F9R devices. 

### [farmbot-ros-polestar](https://github.com/farmbot-ros/polestar)
robot localization 

### [farmbot-ros-trailblazer](https://github.com/Agroecology-Lab/farmbot_planner)
Coverage planner

### [farmbot-ros-pathfinder](https://github.com/farmbot-ros/pathfinder/tree/develop/src)
Navigation planner

### [farmbot-ros-drivecore](https://github.com/Agroecology-Lab/farmbot_controller)
Defines a control system that predicts and optimizes the vehicle's trajectory over a finite time horizon

### [Linrobot2 hardware](https://github.com/rosmo-robot/linorobot2_hardware/tree/master)
Provides base hardware abstraction, sensor & motor driver integration, and already bundles Nav2 (localisation, mapping, planning).

### [flexbe](https://github.com/flexbe) 
FlexBE is a high-level behavior engine coordinating the capabilities of a robot in order to solve complex tasks. Behaviors are modeled as hierarchical state machines (HFSM)

### [flexible_behavior_trees](https://github.com/FlexBE/flexible_behavior_trees)
The FlexBE state implementations send goals to the BT server to load and execute a BT with and without a user defined goal. FlexBE orchestrates the execution of different BTs while the BehaviorTree.CPP framework executes the BTs and passes data between nodes and BTs.
